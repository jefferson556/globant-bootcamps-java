# Globant Java Bootcamp 2018
## Spring - REST - Git - Maven - Testing - RDB

![Globant](assets/globant.jpg)

## __IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER__
This is not your typical _crash course_, this is a **Bootcamp**.

What does that mean?

- _You will give your best_

- _We will give our best_

- _We will all have a good time_


But most important, there will be **A LOT** of humor, because a happy developer _(student, pupil, padawan, you get the point...)_ is a great and hard working developer.


_That said..._

## Welcome to the bootcamp, learning time has begun

![Workout](assets/workout.gif)

Please, use this repository as a base for you training phase. The idea is to
fork this project so everyone use the same folder structure for the
exercises.

It's extremelly important to keep the key points easy to be verified by
the reviewers, so **don't mix the key points with the rest of the
exercises**

→ [index](#index)

### Materials

1. Laptop (Globant will not provide it).

2. Install [Java 8 SDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).

3. You can choose whichever IDE you want, it could be [Eclipse for Java Developers](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/), [IntelliJ Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

4. Slack Account + headset (For eventual zoom audio calls). Please, upload a profile photo to your Slack account so we can easily associate your face with your name.

5. Create your own [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. Follow this [guideline](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) to setup your account. Also you can read further about Git in [Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) or [Learn Git Branching](http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/).

6. Fork this repo https://github.com/ilanrosenfeld7/globant-bootcamps-java to use as a base to host the project code. Read [this](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) for instructions.

→ [index](#index) 


### General Guidelines

1. [Team play](http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/ten-qualities-of-an-effective-team-player.html) is encouraged but the work will be evaluated per person.

2. The instructions will be vague as they generally are in real life projects.
You must look for support and guidance from your PM, teammates and tutors.

3. All code and documentation must be in English.

4. Every additional feature acts like a bonus. If you feel like adding technologies/methodologies/whatever you want that is not taught during the course, go for it!

→ [index](#index)

### Learning Days ###

Each day you will grab the fundamentals of the key building blocks for usual Java applications.

On each learning day you will have to:

1. ### Attend lectures: ###
Just once a week at Globant. One-hour classes with extra time in which you will be able to ask any technical questions.

2. ### Read: ###
We will provide you with documentation related with current sprint content so you can have a background reference, guide and examples to complete the following practice.

3. ### Practice: ###
You will implement the previously gathered knowledge in simple coding activities.
Most important task numbers are listed in the "*Key Points*" section for each day and they should get most of your attention; if you feel you don’t have enough time to complete all tasks, start with these ones when possible.

4. ### Commit: ###
You will commit all your code on a daily basis, when you finish your practice.

→ [index](#index)

### Individual performance ###

After each lecture, you will be given several related exercices which act like a bonus. 

General requirements:

1. Corrections will be made against your fork **master** branch. You can create any additional branch for testing purposes, but ensure your latest changes are in the main branch.

2. Exercices should be solved **individually**.   

3. Extra **documentation** is recommended (e.g., create a *spring_comments.txt* file indicating what has been done and where within your project).

4. After each topic, you will find two types of exercices. The **Practice** section is considered mandatory for everyone. The **Challenges!!** section is optional (of course, try to tackle it too. Every additional task acts like a bonus).

5. There's an **Auto assessment** section after each subject which will help you understand how you're doing. If this becomes too difficult, then you should go back and make a second read. This said, try not to leave concepts/exercices for the end. Every subject is important and it helps (in some way, it is required) to understand the following subject.  

### Final project ###

Each team will have individual meetings with a fictitious client who will ask for new requirements during each session.

General requirements:

1. Every bussiness-related question must be done during these meetings. You should not make these questions to your tutors, who will just answer technical questions. Foresee what's important for the current sprint and write down your doubts before the encounter. Don't waste your time with unneeded issues.

2. Every new feature should be merged through Pull Requests from one of your forks. You **CAN NOT** upload changes directly to your group branch in the upstream repository. Every PR must be approved by **every team member** without exception before merging.

3. Add your **tutor as a reviewer** in your PRs. He will give you useful advices and highlight the errors in your code. He must also approve it before merging it. 

4. All code and documentation must be in **English**. 

5. PRs descriptions must respect the following convention: *group_name-ticket_number-ticket_description*. Tickets descriptions must not exceed 6 words.

6. Every subject given during the course should be included in your final project. You can add any additional tool that you think necessary.

Note that you don't need to create real database connections, [just mock it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object) (create a simulation of them).

1. Create a **singleton** example for a database connection.
2. Create a **abstract factory** example for diferent type of SQL connections. See [this](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/abstract_factory_pattern.htm) example.
3. Create a **proxy** example for database accesor clases.
4. Create a **builder** example for database connection.

1. Refactor your abstract factory example knowing that now you may have both SQL and NoSQL databases.
2. You have a database with different kinds of operations (SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc), and after the execution of each one of these, several Loggers which log this action in detail. Which design pattern would you use and why? Implement it.
3. Suppose now that each Logger may serve for different languages, according to the time of the day. How would you change each Logger behaviour every now and then? Choose the most suitable design pattern for this. Implement it too!

### Practice: ###

1. Download Postman. You will use this client to manually test your REST service.
2. Create your client needed API spec using an Exceel sheet. Upload the *.csv* to your group branch under */src/main/resources*
3. Specify every possible case scenario in each defined endpoint.
4. Create the REST layer for your REST API.
5. Test REST and Service layers.
6. Expose the created REST API.
7. Investigate the **DTO** concept. Add DTO classes to your project.

Note: Do not implement JPA or ORM. Services should return in memory data only for now.

<img src="assets/challenge.png" title="Challenge Logo" width="256" height="100">

8. Document services.
9. Write the **Swagger** file for point 7.
10. Design a UserService for CRUD operations. The API must provide: add, delete, update and find by name and find by nickname operations. Note that the username must be unique.
11. Implement and document previous UserService.
12. Add authorization to your app to just allow the admin user to handle what's been specified in exercice 8.
13. Suppose that the client wants to receive the list of products like this:

```
{
  "total": 4,
  "categories":{
      "food:" 2,
      "drinks":1,
      "bathroom":1
  },
  ... //the same with each of the product's attributes
  ,
  "data":
  [
  {
     //product1 info
    },
    {
      //product2 info
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

Adjust your REST layer in order to return the list of products with this format.

14. Allow the user to buy different items and then decide how to pay them:
 
     * by Credit Card: where a Name and a Credit Number is required.

     * by Paypal: where an email and a password is needed.

     * Cash: no information is required.

15. Add the following discount depending on the payment type

     * 10% by Credit Card.

     * The cheapest item is for free when the user pay by Paypal.

     * 90% of the most expensive item is free if the user pays by Cash.

16. Create a counter to provide unique sequential numbers and use it to set an identification to each payment transaction.

17. Add functionality to display information about the list of items. The item should be displayed as:

     * Item Name ....... $ price

18. Add an offer that includes other individual items or other offers. Take into account that when an offer is displayed, it should say:

     * Offer Name ....... $ price

       - Item Name ...... $ price

19. Add a mailist List where the market manager is notified when:
    
     * A new item/offer is added

     * A price is changed

     * A new transaction was made

### Practice: ###

1. Add tests for the classes in your project. Test every layer using Mocks wherever needed.
2. Use TDD to create the 'Recent file list' behaviour. Some examples of this behaviour is:
  * When the program is run for the first time, the list is empty.
  * When a file is opened, it is added to the recent file list.
  * If an opened file already exists in the recent file list, it is bumped to the top, not duplicated in the list.
  * If the recent file list gets full (typical number of items is 15), the oldest item is removed when a new item is added.
3. Using TDD techniques such as mocking, faking and stubs, try to develop your own blog software featuring:
  * Post new entry
  * Delete existing entry
  * Show 10 most recent entries

<img src="assets/challenge.png" title="Challenge Logo" width="256" height="100">
